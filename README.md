# Design-Pattern
Design Pattern are the pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve recurring design problems in your code.
Design Pattern consist of 
* Intent describes both the problem and the solution.
* Motivation explains problem and solution the pattern makes possible.
* Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern & how they are related.
* Code example gives the understanding how we can implement desing pattern in programming languages.

*Design Pattern is a toolkit of tried and tested solution to common problems in software design.*

### Creational Design Pattern
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
1. Factory Method Pattern
2. Abstract factory Pattern
3. Builder Pattern
4. Prototype Pattern
5. Singleton Pattern

### Structural Design Pattern
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
1. Adapter Pattern
2. Bridge Pattern
3. Composite Pattern
4. Decorator Pattern
5. FACADE Pattern
6. Flyweight Pattern
7. Proxy Pattern

### Behavioral Design Pattern
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
2. Command Pattern
3. Iterator Pattern
4. Mediator Pattern
5. Momento Pattern
6. Observer Pattern
7. State Pattern
8. Strategy Pattern
